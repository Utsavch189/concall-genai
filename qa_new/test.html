    Based on the provided context, primarily from the <b>Q4 FY25</b> earnings call, TCS has focused on several key strategies to drive growth and adapt to market shifts. While the context highlights investments in advanced technologies and responses to market demands, it does not explicitly detail the creation of entirely new revenue streams or the launch of new products over the last three years in a way that suggests distinct, formally branded offerings outside its core service evolution.\n\n<br><b>Growth Strategies:</b>\n*   <b>Pipeline Strengthening and Talent Acquisition:</b> TCS has been strengthening its current pipeline through strategic investment in scale development. It is also gearing up to onboard an increased number of campus hires in <b>FY '26</b>, indicating a focus on talent expansion for future growth.\n*   <b>Operational Efficiency and Revenue Mix Optimization:</b> The company has mitigated headwinds by improving its operating leverage and optimizing its revenue mix, contributing to financial stability and growth in profitability.\n*   <b>Strategic Client Engagements:</b> TCS saw a second consecutive quarter of very strong Total Contract Value (TCV) across markets, composed of a good mix of large, medium, and small deals. This TCV improvement is driven by clients prioritizing initiatives around technology modernization, cost optimization, vendor consolidation, operational model transformation, risk, and compliance.\n*   <b>Vertical-Specific Growth Drivers:</b>\n    *   In the Communications Media and Information vertical, growth improved due to demand from vendor consolidation and technology productivity and improvements programs. There is a noticeable movement towards <b>cloud services</b> and <b>cybersecurity</b>.\n    *   The Energy Resources and Utilities vertical continues to grow well, with a strong pipeline of opportunities. This strength is attributed to investments in advanced technologies such as <b>AI</b>, <b>Gen AI</b>, <b>data analytics</b>, and energy storage, which enhance operational efficiency and reliability.\n*   <b>Growth Markets Focus:</b> TCS continues to see traction in its Growth Markets, characterized by a very strong deal pipeline and robust TCV growth.\n\n<br><b>New Revenue Streams / Products / Innovations:</b>\n*   The provided context does not explicitly mention the creation of entirely new, distinct revenue streams or the launch of specific new products over the last three years.\n*   However, the company highlights its strategic investments in and leverage of advanced technologies. Specifically, in the Energy Resources and Utilities vertical, investments in <b>AI</b>, <b>Gen AI</b>, <b>data analytics</b>, and energy storage are key factors contributing to growth. These indicate an evolution and enhancement of existing service offerings through technological innovation to meet new market demands and opportunities, such as the shift towards new energy sources.\n*   The company also notes client movement towards <b>cloud services</b> and <b>cybersecurity</b>, suggesting that these are areas where TCS is expanding or refining its service portfolio to capture demand, which can lead to new revenue within existing business lines.\n\n<br><b>Financial Performance (Q4 FY25):</b>\n*   Revenue increased by <b>2.5%</b> year-on-year in constant currency terms, reaching <b>â‚¹64,479 crore</b>. In rupee terms, this translates to a growth of <b>5.3%</b>.\n*   Dollar revenues were <b>$7.47 billion</b>, representing a year-on-year growth of <b>1.4%</b>.\n*   Operating margin stood at <b>24.2%</b>.\n*   For the full <b>FY '25</b>, revenue was <b>$30.2 billion</b> and EPS grew <b>5.1%</b> year-on-year.\n\n<br><b>Conclusion:</b>\nTCS's growth strategy is primarily driven by strengthening its deal pipeline, strategic talent acquisition, optimizing operations, and responding to evolving client demands in technology modernization, cloud adoption, and cybersecurity. While the context highlights significant investments in and leverage of advanced technologies like <b>AI</b> and <b>Gen AI</b> within existing verticals to capture new opportunities and enhance service delivery, it does not detail the formal launch of new, distinct products or the establishment of entirely new revenue streams spanning the last three years, focusing instead on recent performance in <b>FY '25</b>.
